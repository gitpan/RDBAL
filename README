This perl library uses perl5 objects to make it easy to retrieve information
about a particular Sybase ,MS SQL, or Oracle databases's schema.  The database
connection is cached in the schema object. Objects and their fields properties
and index information are retrieved when the schema object is created. Table
relationship information is retrieved for all tables when the first
relationship information is requested. 


Schema information available includes: 

Objects: tables, views, and procedures 
Objects' fields (or parameters) 
Objects' fields' properties: type, length, precision, scale, identity column,
     nullable 
Tables' indexes and primary keys 
Parent => child relations between tables including primary key/foreign key
     equivalences. 
Views' and Procedures' definitions (Comments). 
A view's underlying tables.
